    problem: 'Every day, potential clients visit the Vinfotech website with questions — about pricing, timelines, integrations, technologies, or specific product capabilities.\n\nEarlier, these inquiries often required manual intervention or follow-ups from the sales team. To solve this, Vinfotech built its own Autonomous AI Sales Agent that now provides accurate, contextual, and cited responses instantly, available 24/7 on the website.',
    solution: 'Vinfotech developed an Enterprise RAG-powered AI Sales Agent — an intelligent, conversational assistant trained on both structured and unstructured company knowledge. When a visitor asks a question, the agent searches across internal documents, pricing sheets, and web pages, synthesizes a verified, human-like answer with citations to the source documents, and offers relevant follow-up questions to guide the visitor deeper.',
    results: 'This internal project proved how Enterprise RAG and AI agents can revolutionize pre-sales and support. The system delivers factual, cited, and human-quality answers around the clock — allowing sales teams to focus on relationship-building rather than repetitive responses.',
